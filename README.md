# HCP Prediction

## Topic: Healthcare Professionals (HCP) Identification using Ad Server Logs

### Project Description

**Objective:**  
The project aimed to identify Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and predict their specialization using data obtained from ad server logs.

**Context:**  
This was part of a Hackathon project where the goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret ad server logs for meaningful insights into HCP behaviors and specializations.

### Contributions

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Collected ad server logs containing detailed interaction data.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was suitable for analysis and model training.
- Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized the data for better model performance.

#### Feature Engineering

- Extracted relevant features from the ad server logs, such as click patterns, browsing behavior, and interaction frequencies.
- Created new features that could help in distinguishing between different HCPs and their specializations.

#### Model Development

- Implemented various machine learning models to identify HCPs based on their interaction with ads.
- Developed a predictive model to determine the specialization of HCPs using the engineered features.
- Evaluated the performance of different models using appropriate metrics and selected the best-performing model.

#### Model Optimization

- Fine-tuned the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Utilized techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

#### Analysis and Insights

- Analyzed the results to gain insights into the behavior of HCPs based on their interactions with ads.
- Identified key patterns and trends that could help in better targeting and personalization of ads for HCPs.

#### Collaboration and Presentation

- Worked closely with team members to integrate various components of the project.
- Presented the findings and model results to the Hackathon judges, highlighting the practical applications and potential impact of the solution.

### Outcomes

- Successfully identified Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) from the ad server logs with high accuracy.
- Predicted the specialization of HCPs, providing valuable insights for targeted ad campaigns.
- The project demonstrated the potential of using ad server logs for HCP identification and specialization prediction, showcasing an innovative approach in the healthcare and advertising domain.
